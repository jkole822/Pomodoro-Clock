# Pomodoro Clock

## Description

Pomodoro Clock created with React-Redux allowing the user to set alternating timers for work sessions and breaks. Each timer can be incremented or decremented in increments of one minute. An alarm will alert the user after the set time has elapsed for either timer. Additionally, the conclusion of each 'session' automatically triggers the countdown of the 'break', and vice versa.
